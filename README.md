The GPT Model Comparison project is a Python-based tool designed to evaluate and compare the performance of various GPT models provided by OpenAI, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4, including their Turbo variants. This tool allows users to conduct systematic tests across different models using a unified interface that manages chat sessions, tracks message history, and enforces word limits. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, catering to real-time and batch processing needs. The project aims to provide insights into the models' response quality, speed, and coherence, facilitating informed decisions for developers and researchers looking to choose the most suitable GPT model for specific applications. This comparison tool is essential for anyone involved in developing AI-driven conversational systems, offering a structured approach to assessing model capabilities and performance.

To run the GPT Model Comparison tool, follow these steps:
1. Set up your Python environment:
Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed.
Install necessary libraries, possibly using a requirements file if provided:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure API Keys:
Obtain and set up your OpenAI API keys in the configuration file or as environment variables.
4. Select Models for Comparison:
Modify the configuration settings to specify which GPT models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4, Turbo variants) you want to compare.
5. Run the Comparison Script:
Execute the main script from the command line:
```
python compare_gpt_models.py
```  
7. Review Results:
Check the output, which may be printed to the console or saved to a file, detailing the performance metrics and comparison results.
Make sure to check any provided documentation for specific details or additional configuration options.
